`Pomodoro` : [Pomodoro](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) is a productivity technique where a 25 minute work session is followed by a 5 minute break for each pomodoro period. Click on the timer to start the countdown, or double click to switch the timer modes from work to break. A notification will be played when the timer hits 0 so you don't need to keep your eyes on the widget.
